# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Overview
The Employee Attrition Prediction project focuses on predicting employee attrition by employing data cleaning, preprocessing, and various classification models. We have analyzed employee data, cleaned and prepared it for modeling, and applied several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, xgboost, cross validation to predict employee attrition.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:
1. To develop an accurate model for predicting employee attrition, helping organizations retain valuable talent.
2. To gain practical experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning classification techniques.
3. To compare the performance of different classification models in predicting employee attrition.

## Main Features
- Data Cleaning: We cleaned and preprocessed the employee data, handling missing values and outliers.
- Classification Models: We implemented the following classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost Classifier
  - Cross Validation of models above

## Technologies Used
The project was developed using the following technologies and tools:
- Python: Python was the primary programming language used for data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling.
- scikit-learn: scikit-learn library was used for data preprocessing and implementing classification models.
- pandas: pandas library was utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
